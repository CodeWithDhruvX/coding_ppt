      "content": "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides **highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage**. To optimize storage costs and access performance, AWS offers various **storage classes**, each tailored to different data access needs. \n\nFor example, data that’s accessed frequently, like images on a website, can be stored in the **S3 Standard** class, whereas backup logs or compliance archives can go into **S3 Glacier** or **Deep Archive** for long-term, low-cost storage.",

      "title": "Why Use Different Storage Classes?",
      "content": "Not all data is accessed equally. Some files are downloaded frequently (like user photos), while others (like old logs or monthly reports) may sit untouched for years. AWS lets you choose the **right storage class** to align with your access frequency, performance needs, and budget.\n\nAdditionally, AWS allows you to set **lifecycle policies** to automate transitions between classes, like moving files from S3 Standard to Glacier after 90 days of inactivity — saving cost without manual intervention.",
