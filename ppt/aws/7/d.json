      "content": "**AWS Auto Scaling** is a cloud-native service that dynamically adjusts your applicationâ€™s compute capacity based on demand. This means it can automatically increase or decrease the number of Amazon EC2 instances or other AWS services as traffic to your app changes. The goal is to maintain application performance while minimizing cost. It works in real-time and removes the need for manual intervention.",

    {
      "title": "Why Use Auto Scaling?",
      "content": "- **Handles variable workloads**: Auto Scaling ensures that your application can handle increased load during peak times and scale down during idle periods.\n- **High availability**: Keeps your application running even if some instances fail.\n- **Operational efficiency**: Reduces the need for manual monitoring and intervention.\n- **Cost-effective**: Automatically removes unused instances, so you only pay for what you use.",

      "title": "How Auto Scaling Works",
      "content": "1. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: A logical grouping of EC2 instances that AWS manages collectively.\n2. **Launch Configuration or Template**: Defines the configuration (AMI, instance type, etc.) for new instances.\n3. **Scaling Policies**: Define the conditions under which the system should scale in or out.\n4. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Trigger scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization.\n5. **Scaling Actions**: Add or remove instances as needed to match demand with supply.",

      "title": "Key Components of Auto Scaling",
      "content": "- **Launch Template/Configuration**: Specifies the configuration for launching EC2 instances. It includes AMI ID, instance type, security groups, key pairs, and more.\n- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: The core of Auto Scaling. It maintains a specified number of instances across multiple Availability Zones.\n- **Scaling Policies**: These are rules based on performance metrics or schedules that instruct AWS when to scale up or down. They can be simple thresholds or advanced step adjustments.",

For example, add instances when CPU usage exceeds 70%.\n- **Scheduled Scaling**: Useful for predictable load patterns. You can schedule scale actions (e.g., every weekday at 9 AM).\n- **Predictive Scaling**: Uses machine learning to analyze historical trends and forecast future traffic, allowing AWS to proactively adjust capacity before demand changes.",
