      "content": "- **Bucket**: A bucket is a logical container for storing objects. Each AWS account can create up to 100 buckets by default. Bucket names must be globally unique.\n- **Object**: Objects are the actual data stored in buckets. An object consists of the data, a key (unique name), and optional metadata.\n- **Key**: Every object inside a bucket is identified by a key, which acts like a file path in a traditional file system.\n- **Region**: Buckets are created in specific AWS regions, which helps in reducing latency and meeting compliance or data residency requirements.",

Still supported but less recommended for new applications.\n- **Presigned URLs**: Temporary URLs that grant time-limited access to specific objects without needing full credentials.
