Alright, let’s start with a simple question — what exactly is system design?

Now, if you're just getting into programming or maybe preparing for your first tech interview, you’ve probably heard this term thrown around a lot. But what does it really mean?

System design is basically the planning phase before building a big application — like how architects plan a building before it's actually constructed.

Imagine you're working on a project like a food delivery app — something like Swiggy or Zomato. You don’t just start coding randomly, right? You need to think about how different parts of your app will work together — like how orders will be placed, how the delivery updates will be tracked, where the data will be stored, and how users will log in.

That entire planning — figuring out how things will talk to each other, how to keep things fast even with lots of users, how to avoid system crashes — that’s called system design.

It happens at two levels:

At a high level, you're deciding stuff like: “Should I break this into microservices?”, “What kind of database should I use?”, or “How do I scale if one lakh people use it at the same time?”

At a low level, it’s more like: “What will the class structure look like?”, “What indexes do I need on this table?”, or “What APIs should I expose?”

So think of system design as the bridge between your business idea and the actual code you'll write. It helps you build apps that are not just working, but also reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

And here’s the thing — whether you’re building your own startup idea, working in a tech company, or giving a software interview — system design skills are super important. Companies expect you to not just write code, but also to design clean systems that can handle real-world usage.

So in short: system design is how you go from idea to architecture. It’s where the real thinking happens before the real coding begins.





======================================================================================



Okay, now that we know what system design is, let’s talk about why it even matters.

See, when you're building small projects — like a calculator app or a to-do list — you might not worry too much about how everything is structured. But once you start building something bigger — like an e-commerce site, a social media app, or a payment system — then how you design the system becomes super important.

Let’s look at a few reasons why:

First up: Scalability.
This just means: Can your system handle more users as it grows?
For example, imagine you launch an app and 100 people use it on Day 1. No problem. But what if 1 lakh people start using it after a week? If your system isn't designed well, it might crash or slow down badly. Good system design makes sure your app can grow smoothly.

Next: Reliability.
Think of it like this — even if something goes wrong in one part of the system, the rest of it should still work.
Like when UPI is down for one bank, but you can still pay through another one — that’s reliability. A well-designed system can handle failures without breaking everything.

Third is Maintainability.
This means your codebase should be easy to update or fix later.
Let’s say your manager tells you to add a new feature or change a flow — if your system is messy, it becomes a headache. But if it’s cleanly designed, changes are smoother and faster.

Fourth: Performance.
Nobody likes a slow app. If your design doesn’t plan for fast data access or quick response times, users will get frustrated.
Think of booking train tickets on IRCTC during peak hours — if performance is bad, you miss the ticket.

And finally: Cost-efficiency.
This one's underrated. You don’t want your system to use 10 servers when 2 would do the job.
A smart design saves cloud costs, storage, and processing power — which is a big deal, especially for startups and small teams.

So in short — a well-designed system is like a solid foundation for a house. If you mess it up, everything you build on top becomes shaky. But if you get it right, your application becomes strong, smooth, and ready to grow.




===============================================================================================



Alright! Now let’s break down the two main types of system design — High-Level Design and Low-Level Design. These are often called HLD and LLD.

Let’s understand this with a simple example.
Imagine you’re planning to build a new house.

High-Level Design is like creating the blueprint for the house — where the rooms will be, how big they are, where the doors and windows go, and what materials you’ll use.
You’re not thinking about which screw goes where — just the big picture.

In software, HLD does the same thing. It talks about the overall structure of your system — what components you’ll have, how they’ll interact, what technologies you’ll use.

For example:

Will your app use a load balancer to distribute traffic?

Will it have a REST API?

Will it use a SQL database or a NoSQL one?

How will different services — like login, payments, or notifications — talk to each other?

That’s all part of High-Level Design. It gives you a macro view — the big architecture.

Now let’s talk about Low-Level Design, or LLD.

LLD is like getting into the actual construction work. Now you’re thinking about exactly where the electrical wires go, how the plumbing connects, and which size of tiles you’re using. Basically, you’re taking the blueprint and turning it into an actual plan to build.

In software, LLD is about zooming into each module or feature, and planning:

What functions you’ll write,

What data types they’ll use,

How classes will interact,

And how the logic will flow.

So for example, if your HLD says "we need a payment module", then your LLD will describe how that payment module works, step by step.

Why does this matter?

Because if you skip HLD, your system may become a mess as it grows. And if you skip LLD, your team might not know how to actually implement features without bugs or confusion.

So, both HLD and LLD are essential — HLD tells you what to build, and LLD tells you exactly how to build it.













=======================================================================



Now let’s talk about some of the core concepts you’ll come across in system design. Think of these like the basic building blocks — the more you understand them, the better your system design skills will get.

Let’s go through them one by one:

Scalability – This simply means: Can your system grow without breaking?
Let’s say you build a website and suddenly your college mates, then your college, then your whole city starts using it. Will your app still work smoothly? That’s scalability. A good design makes sure the system performs well even with a huge number of users.

Load Balancing – Imagine you have 5 counters in a bank and people are standing in line. Instead of all going to one counter, they spread out evenly — that’s load balancing. In system terms, it means traffic or requests get evenly distributed to avoid overloading any single server.

Caching – Ever noticed how Google shows your search suggestions super fast? That’s because it’s not pulling data from scratch every time. It’s using cached data — temporary stored data — so things load quicker. Caching helps speed up your app by avoiding repeat processing.

Database Design – This is all about how you store and access your data. Should you use tables? Collections? What kind of indexes? Good database design makes your system fast, clean, and easy to query.

Data Consistency Models – Let’s say you transfer ₹500 from your Paytm wallet to your friend, but on your screen it shows “sent” and on your friend’s phone it doesn’t show up — that’s a consistency issue. A system should maintain correct data across all parts. Consistency models help manage that, especially in distributed systems.

Microservices vs Monolith – This is about how you organize your code.

A monolith is one big application with everything inside it — like a single project file.

Microservices break things down — login, payments, orders — each one runs separately.
Microservices give flexibility, but they add complexity too. So it’s all about trade-offs.

API Design – APIs are how systems talk to each other. If you’ve ever fetched weather data using an API, you’ve seen this in action. A clean API makes it easy for different parts of your system — or even other apps — to communicate smoothly.

Security – This is super important. You need to protect your data, avoid unauthorized access, and prevent leaks. Especially if you're handling things like payments or personal info, a secure system design is non-negotiable.

Monitoring & Logging – Once your system is live, you need to know what’s happening inside. Is it healthy? Are there errors? Logging helps you keep track of issues, and monitoring shows you the live status of your system. It’s like keeping an eye on your system’s heartbeat.

So in short — these concepts are what you’ll keep using again and again while building any real-world project. Whether you're designing a chat app, a travel site, or a banking system, mastering these makes your design solid, stable, and future-ready.







==================================================================================


Now let’s talk about something that comes up a lot in system design — Scalability.

So what does scalability really mean?

Imagine you launch a new app — maybe a college events app where students can register for fests. At first, you have 100 users. All good. But suddenly, the app goes viral — and now 10,000 people are using it at once. If your system can still handle it smoothly, that is a scalable system.

Scalability is all about making sure your app can grow with demand — without slowing down or crashing.

There are two main ways to scale:

First: Horizontal Scaling
This means adding more machines to share the load.
Think of it like this — if one pizza delivery guy can’t handle 100 orders, you hire more delivery guys. Similarly, if one server is struggling, you add more servers and spread the traffic. This is usually more flexible and is used in large systems.

Second: Vertical Scaling
Here, you make your existing machine stronger.
So instead of adding more servers, you just upgrade the CPU, add more RAM, or increase the storage. It’s like giving your one delivery guy a bike, then a car, then a jet — faster, but still just one person. It works, but there’s a limit to how much you can upgrade.

Along with these, system design also uses some helpful techniques:

Partitioning – breaking data into smaller chunks, like splitting a big table into regions.

Replication – copying data to multiple servers for faster access and backup.

Distributed Computing – splitting tasks across many machines so they work in parallel.

Why does this matter?

Because whether you're building a startup, a government app, or even an internal tool, you don’t want your system to fail just because more people are using it. A scalable design gives users a smooth experience — no delays, no downtime.

So remember — scalability isn’t a feature, it’s a mindset. It’s about planning ahead so your app doesn’t just work today, but also works when it grows tomorrow.










===================================================================================



Let’s now talk about Load Balancing — a really important concept in system design, especially when you’re building something that needs to handle a lot of users.

So here’s a simple way to understand it.

Imagine you go to a popular food court — and there are 5 counters serving food. If everyone stands in just one line, the wait becomes super long. But if someone is there to guide people and spread them across all 5 counters evenly, the service becomes much faster and smoother, right?

That’s exactly what a load balancer does — but in a digital system.

It sits in front of your servers and distributes the incoming traffic so that no single server is overloaded. If 10,000 users are hitting your app, the load balancer decides which server handles which request. This helps with:

Speed (since no server is overloaded),

Reliability (if one server crashes, others can still handle traffic),

And availability (your app stays live even under high traffic).

Now let’s talk about how it actually decides where to send each request. There are some common algorithms it uses:

Round-robin – Just like a teacher calling roll number by roll number, this method sends each new request to the next server in a loop.

Least connections – It checks which server is least busy and sends the request there. This is useful when some tasks take longer than others.

IP hash – It picks a server based on the user’s IP address. This way, the same user might always be sent to the same server — helpful in some use cases like sessions.

And in terms of tools — you can use:

Software-based options like Nginx or HAProxy — these are really popular in the developer world.

Or cloud-based ones like AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer), which are managed by cloud providers and scale automatically.

So, to sum up — load balancing is what keeps your system calm under pressure.
Whether it’s 100 users or 1 lakh users — a good load balancer makes sure no one server crashes from overload and your app keeps running smoothly.




========================================================================================



🟩 Script for Slide 7: “Caching”

Now let’s talk about Caching — one of those super useful tricks that makes your app feel lightning fast.

So what is caching?

Think of it like this — if you're preparing for an exam and you've already written down all the important formulas in one place, you don’t flip through the entire textbook again and again. You just look at your notes — it’s faster.

In the same way, caching stores frequently used data in a spot that’s super quick to access — usually in memory — so the system doesn’t waste time fetching or calculating the same thing again.

Let’s say your app keeps asking the database for the top 10 trending products. Instead of querying the database every single time, you just cache that result — so the next time someone asks, your app gives the answer instantly, like opening a cheat sheet.

Now there are three common types of caching:

Client-side caching – This happens on the user’s device or browser. So things like images, or stylesheets, can load faster when the user revisits the site.

Server-side caching – This is where your backend system stores frequently accessed data in tools like Redis or Memcached. These are super-fast in-memory databases used just for caching.

CDN caching – A Content Delivery Network like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront stores your static files — like images, videos, CSS — closer to the user’s location, so they load faster even if the main server is far away.

Now here’s the key thing — caching isn’t just about speed. It also reduces load on your servers and improves throughput, which means your system can handle more users at once.

But — caching isn’t magic. You need to manage it well. Two important ideas here are:

Eviction policy – This decides which data gets removed from the cache when it’s full. Like LRU — Least Recently Used — which removes old, unused items first.

Cache invalidation – This makes sure that outdated or wrong data is removed from the cache at the right time. For example, if a product price changes, your cache should update it — or users might see stale info.

So yeah — caching is a must-know skill in system design. Whether it’s a search feature, product listing, or user profile — if it’s something that’s accessed again and again, caching can seriously boost speed and efficiency.





========================================================================


Now let’s talk about Database Design — something that has a huge impact on how your app performs, scales, and stays maintainable in the long run.

Let’s start with the basics — you’ve got two broad types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.

SQL databases — like MySQL and PostgreSQL — are relational.
That means they store data in tables, kind of like Excel sheets. You have rows and columns, and relationships between tables are clearly defined.
The biggest advantage? They follow ACID properties — that’s just a fancy way of saying they’re very strict about keeping your data correct, consistent, and safe, even if there’s a crash or power failure.

On the other hand, NoSQL databases — like MongoDB or Cassandra — are more flexible.
They don’t use tables in the traditional sense. Instead, you might store data as JSON-like documents or key-value pairs. These databases are great when your data structure is not fixed, or when you're dealing with massive amounts of data that’s spread across the globe. They usually follow eventual consistency, which means the data might take a few seconds to sync everywhere — but that trade-off gives you more scalability.

So how do you decide between them?

If you need strong relationships between your data — like a banking system where accuracy is non-negotiable — go for SQL.

But if you're building something like a social media feed, where flexibility and scale matter more, NoSQL could be a better fit.

Now, database design isn’t just about picking SQL or NoSQL. You also need to think about things like:

Normalization – Organizing data to remove duplication.
For example, instead of storing a user's name in every order, you keep it once in a user table and just reference it.

Indexing – Creating shortcuts so your searches are faster.
Think of it like a book index — instead of flipping every page, you go straight to the topic.

Partitioning – Splitting your data across multiple databases or tables, often used when data grows too big.

Replication – Making multiple copies of your data in different locations. It helps with both speed and backup in case of failures.

So yeah — database design is not just a backend task, it’s a core part of your system design.
If you get it right, everything becomes faster, easier to scale, and easier to maintain. But if you get it wrong, even the best code won’t save your app from slowing down or crashing under pressure.









===================================================================================




Alright, now let’s talk about something that sounds a little theoretical but is super important in system design — the CAP Theorem.

So first, what does CAP stand for?

It stands for:

Consistency

Availability

Partition Tolerance

And here’s what the CAP Theorem says:
In a distributed system — which means your system runs on multiple machines, maybe even in different cities or countries — you can only guarantee two out of these three things at the same time. You cannot have all three together.

Let’s break them down one by one:

1. Consistency — This means every user sees the latest data.
So if you update your phone number in one place, and your friend checks your profile from another device, they should see the updated number immediately. That’s consistency.

2. Availability — This means the system always responds.
Even if the data might be a little outdated, the system will never leave you hanging. It will give some response — something is better than nothing.

3. Partition Tolerance — This means the system continues working even if some parts of the network are down.
In real life, this is super common. Maybe one data center goes down, or your app servers in Mumbai can’t reach the database in Delhi due to a network issue. Even during such “partitions,” your system should still function.

Now, CAP Theorem says you can only have two at a time. So let’s look at the combinations:

If you choose Consistency + Availability, you must give up Partition Tolerance. That means if there's a network issue, your system might fail altogether.

If you choose Consistency + Partition Tolerance, you may have to reject some requests during outages — so Availability drops.

If you choose Availability + Partition Tolerance, then you might return slightly stale data, which means consistency is sacrificed.

So depending on what kind of system you're building, you’ll need to decide your trade-offs.

For example:

A banking app needs strong Consistency — your balance must always be correct.

A messaging app like WhatsApp might prefer Availability — even if your message is slightly delayed, the system must respond.

An e-commerce site during a big sale might choose Partition Tolerance + Availability, so it keeps running even during massive traffic, even if some prices are slightly outdated.

So yeah — CAP Theorem isn’t just theory. It forces you to think: what matters most for your system?
That’s why it’s one of the core ideas in designing reliable, scalable distributed systems.





=============================================================================



Alright, let’s now talk about Message Queues — a super useful concept, especially when you’re dealing with asynchronous communication in system design.

Now first — what does asynchronous mean?

Simple example — let’s say you place an order on Swiggy. After you hit “Order Now,” you don’t sit and wait while the restaurant is being notified, food is being cooked, delivery is being assigned — right?

Instead, you immediately get a message like “Order Confirmed,” and the rest of the process happens in the background. That’s asynchronous — the system doesn’t wait to finish everything before moving on. It just queues the tasks and processes them separately.

This is exactly what message queues help with.

They allow different parts of your system to talk to each other without waiting. So instead of one service blocking another, it simply drops a message into a queue, and the other service will pick it up when it’s ready.

Some popular tools for this are:

Kafka

RabbitMQ

Amazon SQS

Let’s say your app receives a new user sign-up. You want to:

Save their data in the database.

Send them a welcome email.

Notify your analytics system.

Maybe even generate a referral code.

Now doing all of this at once would slow things down for the user. But with a message queue, your system just adds these tasks to the queue, and other background workers will process them one by one — while the user sees "Signup Successful" instantly.

Message queues are especially important in microservice architectures, where different parts of your system are running independently. They help with:

Decoupling – so one service doesn’t need to know how the other works.

Buffering load – handling sudden traffic without crashing.

Eventual consistency – ensuring updates happen even if there's a slight delay.

So yeah — message queues may sound fancy, but they’re just like task organizers for your backend. They keep things smooth, fast, and reliable — especially when you’re building large-scale apps that need to handle multiple tasks in the background.





==================================================================================




🟩 Script for Slide 11: “Microservices vs Monolith”

Now let’s talk about something that often comes up in job interviews — Monolith vs Microservices.

These are two ways of structuring your backend code — and each has its own pros and cons. So let me break it down in a way that’s easy to understand.

First, what is a Monolith?
Imagine you’re building a college management app — it has user login, course registration, fees, attendance, and reports — and you write all of this in one single codebase. It’s one big project, one server, one deployment. That’s a monolith.

It’s simple to build at the start. Easy to test, easy to deploy. Great for small teams or beginners working on personal projects.

But here’s the problem: as your app grows, it becomes harder to manage. Changing one part can affect other parts. Deployments get risky, and scaling is a headache — because everything is tightly connected.

Now what about Microservices?
This approach splits your application into smaller, independent services.
So login is one service, payment is another, attendance is a third — each can be built, deployed, and scaled separately. Teams can own specific services, work faster, and make independent updates.

This is really powerful for big companies or large-scale systems. Like how Amazon or Netflix runs — they have hundreds of microservices working together.

But microservices are not free magic. They come with their own challenges:

You need to handle communication between services, often using APIs or message queues.

You’ll need monitoring tools to track which service is failing.

And deployments become more complex — especially when services depend on each other.

So which one should you choose?
If you’re just starting out — or building a small to medium app — a monolith is totally fine.

But if you expect your system to grow fast, have multiple teams, or need to scale parts independently — microservices make sense.

The key is — don’t jump to microservices too early. Start simple, and then break things apart only when needed.






=============================================================================================

Now let’s look at a topic that’s super important in real-world development — API Design.

So what is an API?

Think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. You don’t go inside the kitchen, right? You just tell the waiter what you want — and they bring it to you. Similarly, an API lets two systems talk to each other without revealing what’s going on behind the scenes.

Now in system design, the way you design your APIs affects how easy it is to build, scale, and connect with other systems.

Let’s talk about the three most common API styles:

1. REST – This is the most popular style.
It’s simple and uses HTTP — like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE — and works with “resources.”
For example, /users or /orders/123.

If you’ve ever built a backend with Express.js or Django, you’ve probably used REST APIs.

They’re easy to understand, especially for beginners, and widely supported across platforms.

2. GraphQL – This is like ordering à la carte.
With REST, you often get too much or too little data. But with GraphQL, you can query exactly what you want.

For example, if you just want a user’s name and email — not their full profile — GraphQL gives you only that.

It’s powerful when your frontend team needs flexibility, especially in mobile apps where you want to save data and battery.

3. gRPC – This is a more advanced, high-performance API style.
It’s used mostly internally, when one backend service talks to another — like microservices.

It’s super fast and efficient, but a bit more complex to set up compared to REST or GraphQL.

So why does API design matter?

Well, a well-designed API makes your system:

Easier to understand and use,

Faster to develop,

And better prepared to connect with other systems — like payment gateways, mobile apps, or third-party tools.

Whether you're building your first backend project or working in a team, learning when and how to use REST, GraphQL, or gRPC will make you a much stronger engineer.


=========================================================================================



🟩 Script for Slide 13: “Security”

Okay, let’s talk about something that every developer must care about — Security.

Even if your app is super fast or has the best features — if it’s not secure, it can easily be attacked or misused. So let’s go through the key elements of security, especially in system design.

First up — Authentication
This is where the system checks who you are.
Think of it like showing your college ID card at the gate — it proves you’re a student.

In tech, we usually do this with things like OAuth (used by Google login) or JWT (JSON Web Token).
So if a user logs in with their email and password, the system gives them a token — like a temporary pass — that proves they’re allowed to use the app.

Next — Authorization
Now that we know who the user is, we check what they’re allowed to do.

Let’s say two people log in — a student and an admin. Both are authenticated, but only the admin should be allowed to update marks or delete records.

That’s what authorization controls.

Then comes — Data Encryption
This means converting sensitive data into a format that can’t be easily read by others.
It protects the data both in transit (while it’s moving between your app and the server) and at rest (when it’s stored in the database).

So even if someone somehow steals the data, they can’t make sense of it without the encryption key.

You might’ve heard of HTTPS — that’s an example of encryption in transit.

And finally — Rate Limiting
This is about protecting your system from abuse.

Let’s say someone writes a bot to hit your login API 10,000 times in a minute — trying to guess passwords. That’s a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Rate limiting puts a cap on how many requests a user or IP can make in a given time — for example, max 100 logins per hour — so the system stays safe and stable.

The key thing to remember here is:

Security is not one single feature — it’s a mindset.

You have to build it into every layer — your APIs, databases, user flows, even logs.

Whether you’re just starting out or working on a real project, thinking about security from day one will make you a much more responsible and professional developer.




================================================================


Of course! Here's your YouTube script segment for the slide titled “Monitoring & Logging”, explained in a friendly, beginner-focused, and Indian-context tone:

🟩 Script for Slide 14: “Monitoring & Logging”

Alright, let’s wrap up with something that’s often ignored but super important — Monitoring and Logging.

So imagine this — your app is live, users are using it, and suddenly something breaks.

Now what?
How will you know what went wrong, where it happened, and why?

That’s where observability comes in — and it’s made up of three key things:

1. Logs
Logs are like a diary for your app. Every time something important happens — like a user logs in, or a payment fails — your app writes that down in a log file.

If something goes wrong, you can go back, read the logs, and figure out what happened.
Like reading clues in a detective case.

Tools like ELK Stack help collect and search through logs easily.

2. Metrics
These are numbers that tell you how your system is doing.

For example:

How many users are active right now?

What’s the average response time?

How much memory is your app using?

You can plot these numbers in beautiful dashboards using tools like Prometheus and Grafana — and they give you a live view of your system’s health.

Think of it like a health monitor for your app.

3. Alerts
Now let’s say your server suddenly goes down at 2 AM.
Wouldn’t it be nice if you got a message instantly?

That’s what alerts do.

You can set rules — like “if error rate goes above 5%, send an alert on Slack or email” — so you can react quickly before users start complaining.

Monitoring and logging help you do two main things:

Diagnose issues quickly when something breaks.

And track performance so you can plan improvements.

So even if you’re just starting out, try to get into the habit of writing meaningful logs, tracking basic metrics, and thinking about alerts. It’ll save you a lot of pain later, and make you stand out as a thoughtful developer.















===================================================================================================



🟩 Script for Slide 15: “System Design Process”

Alright, now that we’ve covered the key concepts, let’s talk about how to actually approach a system design problem — step by step.

This is super useful, especially if you're preparing for interviews or building something from scratch.

Let’s break it down:

1. Clarify Requirements
Before jumping into architecture or databases, first ask:
👉 What does the system need to do?

There are two types of requirements:

Functional – like "user can upload a photo" or "system sends OTP".

Non-functional – like "should handle 10,000 users", or "should be secure".

Understanding both is super important — otherwise, you might build something that technically works, but doesn't meet real needs.

2. Define APIs & Use Cases
Once you know what the system should do, think about:

What are the main actions or features?

What kind of inputs and outputs will the APIs handle?

For example, in a food delivery app — you'll have APIs to search restaurants, place orders, track delivery, etc.

3. Design Data Models
Next, figure out how your data will be stored.

Design your database schema — things like tables, fields, relationships.
Don’t forget indexes! They help with fast searches.

For example, an orders table should link to a users table and maybe a restaurants table too.

4. Choose Architecture
Now comes the fun part — choosing how the system is structured.

Will it be a monolith, where everything is in one codebase?
Or microservices, where each feature is a separate service?
Sometimes a hybrid works best.

Make your choice based on team size, feature complexity, and future plans.

5. Plan for Scalability
Your system may start small, but what if 1 lakh users show up?

So think ahead — maybe use load balancing, add caching, or shard the database.

This keeps your app fast, even under heavy traffic.

6. Handle Failures
No system is perfect. Servers crash. Networks fail.

Add retry logic, keep backup servers, and use monitoring tools to catch issues early.

7. Secure the System
We already discussed this in detail — but always make sure to include:

Authentication

Authorization

Encryption

Security should never be an afterthought.

8. Set Up Monitoring
Finally, make sure you can observe your system.

Add logs, collect metrics, and set up alerts so you're not surprised when things break.

So this entire process — from requirements to monitoring — is not a one-time thing.
It’s iterative and collaborative. You build, test, fix, and improve.

The better you follow this process, the stronger and more reliable your system becomes.

🟩 Script for Slide: “Example: Design a URL Shortener”

Alright! Let’s now look at a practical example of how all this system design theory actually comes together.

We’re going to design a simple but popular system — a URL shortener.
You’ve probably used services like Bitly or TinyURL, right?
They take a long, ugly link and convert it into a short one — something like bit.ly/abc123.

So let’s see what components are needed to build this kind of system.

1. API Layer
This is the part that talks to the user.

When someone sends a POST request with a long URL, this API should return a shortened one.

When someone sends a GET request to the short URL, it should redirect them to the original long URL.

So basically — this is where users interact with our system.

2. Hash Generator
Now, once we get the long URL, we need to create a short code — something like abc123.

This is done by a hashing algorithm that turns the long link into a unique short string.

One challenge here is to make sure that no two URLs get the same short code — that’s called a collision — and we want to avoid that.

3. Database
We need to store the mapping between the long and short URLs somewhere.

The database holds both values, so whenever someone visits the short URL, we can quickly look up the original one.

4. Cache
Let’s say some short links are super popular — like links shared on social media.

To avoid hitting the database again and again, we can store them in cache — using something like Redis — so we get faster responses.

5. Analytics Service
Let’s say we want to track how many people clicked a link, where they came from, which browser they used — things like that.

An analytics service captures and stores this data, which is super useful if you’re building a business around this tool.

6. Rate Limiter
Now imagine someone is trying to spam your system by generating thousands of short URLs in one minute.

A rate limiter stops this — it limits how many requests each user can make in a given time.

You can think of it like a speed breaker to control traffic.

Challenges
Of course, this system has real-world challenges too:

Handling collisions when two URLs accidentally generate the same hash.

Scaling the system when millions of people are using it.

And tracking analytics without making the system slow.

So even for a small tool like a URL shortener, there’s a lot of thinking and planning involved — and this is what system design is all about.

🟩 Script for Slide: “Example: Design Netflix”

Alright! Let’s take one more example to understand how system design applies in the real world — this time, something huge — Netflix.

Now I know most of us have used Netflix, or at least heard of it. But have you ever wondered how it actually works behind the scenes?

Let’s break it down in simple terms.

1. Content Delivery
When you press “play” on a movie or web series, the video has to reach you quickly — even if you're in India and the server is somewhere in the US.

To make this fast, Netflix uses something called CDNs, or Content Delivery Networks.
These are servers placed all over the world, so the video is streamed from a server that's closest to you — which means less buffering and a smoother experience.

2. User Authentication
Of course, Netflix needs to make sure it's you who's logging in, and not someone else.

That’s where authentication comes in — secure login with email, password, OTP, maybe even multi-device tracking.

And once you're logged in, your session needs to be managed securely, so that the system remembers who you are while you keep browsing.

3. Recommendation Engine
Ever noticed how Netflix seems to “know” what you want to watch next?

That’s because of its recommendation engine. It uses machine learning to study your watch history and suggest similar content — like if you watch a lot of comedy, it’ll keep recommending more comedy shows.

This engine is a big part of what keeps users engaged — so it’s a very important part of the design.

4. Scalable Backend
Netflix doesn’t run as one big piece of code — it uses a microservices architecture.

That means each feature — like user profile, billing, content streaming, recommendations — is handled by a separate service.

This makes the system scalable, so millions of users can stream without issues, and engineers can deploy updates to individual features without breaking everything else.

5. Video Storage
Storing video content is expensive and tricky — imagine storing every season of every show in multiple formats and resolutions.

So Netflix uses a hot and cold storage strategy:

Frequently watched content is kept in fast-access “hot” storage,

And less-watched stuff goes into slower, cheaper “cold” storage.

This helps manage cost without compromising performance.

Final Thoughts
Now, the key design goals for something like Netflix are:

It should always be available — even if a server fails, you should still be able to watch.

It should buffer as little as possible.

And it should work smoothly across devices — whether it’s your phone, laptop, or TV.

So designing a system like Netflix means thinking about performance, reliability, cost, and user experience — all at the same time.

And that is what makes system design such an important and exciting skill to learn.
