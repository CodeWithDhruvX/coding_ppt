      "content": "Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load (like users, data, traffic) **without compromising performance**. It determines how well a system can grow and adapt to changes.\n\nIn technical terms, a scalable system can manage increased demand by efficiently using resources such as CPU, memory, network, and storage — while continuing to deliver a consistent experience to users.\n\nScalability is not just about adding hardware — it's about smart design, distributed architecture, load balancing, and efficient processing.",

      "title": "Why is Scalability Important?",
      "content": "- Supports growing users or data volumes\n- Ensures good performance under heavy traffic\n- Enables cost-effective growth\n- Essential for modern apps like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook\n\nWithout scalability, systems may crash or slow down under pressure, leading to poor user experience, lost revenue, and reputational damage.\n\nScalable systems are more reliable, future-proof, and easier to expand when the business grows.",

      "content": "- Vertical Scalability (Scale-Up): Upgrade the existing machine to handle more load.\n- Horizontal Scalability (Scale-Out): Add more machines or instances to handle more users or requests.\n- Database Scalability: Adjust how data is stored and accessed using sharding or replication.\n- Network Scalability: Handle increased network traffic with CDNs, load balancers, and edge servers.\n- Software/Application Scalability: Optimize the code and architecture to efficiently handle more traffic and processing tasks.\n\nEach type requires different planning, tools, and architectural considerations to implement effectively.",

      "content": "You increase the capacity of a **single machine** — by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage.\n\nExample: Upgrading a server from 8GB RAM to 64GB.\n\nThis is often the first step in scaling a system because it’s simple and doesn't require changing the architecture. However, it's limited by the maximum specs a single machine can support, and may result in a single point of failure.",
