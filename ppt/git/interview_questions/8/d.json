      "content": "**Staging** in Git is a step between modifying files and committing those changes. It allows you to prepare the files you want to include in your next commit, providing an opportunity to review changes before finalizing them. In simpler terms, it's like selecting only the files or portions of files that you want to commit while leaving the others for later.\n\n- You edit files in your working directory.\n- You stage changes, essentially preparing them for the next commit.\n- Finally, you commit the staged changes to the repository.\n\nThis process helps in committing only relevant changes and organizing your commits logically.",

      "title": "Git Workflow Overview",
      "content": "Git follows a three-step process for managing changes:\n\n1. **Working Directory**: This is where you make changes to files. You edit and modify your project here, but these changes are not yet tracked by Git.\n2. **Staging Area (Index)**: After editing a file, you stage it. This tells Git, 'These are the changes I want to include in the next commit.' It acts like a holding area before the actual commit.\n3. **Repository**: The commit takes the staged changes and stores them in Git's repository, where they become part of the project's history.\n\nEach step in this workflow ensures that you have full control over what gets included in each commit.",

Here's a quick recap:\n\n- **`git add .`**: Stages all changes in the working directory.\n- **`git add filename.txt`**: Stages a specific file.\n- **`git status`**: Shows the status of your working directory and staging area, letting you know which changes are staged and which are not.\n- **`git reset filename.txt`**: Unstages a file, removing it from the staging area but leaving changes in the working directory.\n\nBy using the staging area effectively, you can have full control over your commit history and ensure that each commit is well-structured and logical.",
