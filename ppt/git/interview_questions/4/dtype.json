This action transforms your normal directory into a Git repository. From this point onward, Git can start tracking every change made to your files. Think of it as turning on the 'black box recorder' for your codebase. Initialization doesn’t change your code, but it sets up Git’s internal system to begin logging all version history and changes.",

To start tracking changes, you need to explicitly add files with `git add` and commit them using `git commit`. Until then, Git knows the repo exists but hasn't recorded any history.",

It gives you a working directory and `.git/` tracking folder.\n- `git init --bare`: Used for creating central repositories (usually on servers). It doesn’t have a working directory, meaning you can’t edit files directly here—it’s used strictly for pushing and pulling.\nUnderstanding this distinction helps when collaborating in distributed teams or setting up self-hosted Git servers.",

Every file, folder, and commit is stored as a hashed object inside `.git/objects`. This system ensures high performance and security since objects are immutable and identified by unique SHA-1 hashes. When you modify files, Git creates a new snapshot rather than diffing files line by line. It’s like taking a full photograph of your code at each save point.",
