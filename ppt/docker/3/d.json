      "content": "Understanding the difference between **Docker** and a **Virtual Machine (VM)** is essential for modern software development and deployment. Both are technologies used to create isolated environments, but they differ significantly in terms of architecture, performance, and resource usage. Developers often choose between them based on their needs for speed, scalability, compatibility, or security.",

      "title": "What is Docker?",
      "content": "**Docker** is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications along with all their dependencies into a single unit called a **container**. These containers run directly on the host operating system's kernel, which makes them extremely lightweight and fast. Docker helps eliminate the 'it works on my machine' problem by ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It is ideal for microservices, scalable deployments, and agile workflows.",

      "title": "What is a Virtual Machine?",
      "content": "A **Virtual Machine (VM)** emulates a complete physical computer. It runs a full operating system (called a guest OS) on top of a **hypervisor**, which itself runs on the host OS. Each VM includes virtual hardware such as CPU, memory, disk, and network interfaces. This makes VMs heavier and slower to start, but they provide strong isolation and are suitable for running different OS environments on a single physical machine.",
