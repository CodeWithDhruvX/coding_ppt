      "slide_type": "behavioral",
      "content": "As the project manager of a cross-functional initiative to launch a customer-facing feature, I led a team of 12 members from product, engineering, QA, and customer support—some co-located, others fully remote. Our success depended on collaborative input from all departments to build a well-rounded solution."

      "slide_type": "behavioral",
      "content": "Early in the project, I observed that contributions during meetings were dominated by product and engineering. Support and QA, particularly remote employees, often remained silent. Their feedback was crucial, especially for edge cases and usability concerns, yet they didn’t feel empowered to speak up."

      "title": "Taking Proactive Steps to Foster Inclusion",
      "slide_type": "behavioral",
      "content": "To create a more inclusive environment, I initiated structured agendas and encouraged input from every function during meetings. I rotated facilitators to distribute leadership moments and introduced asynchronous discussion threads to accommodate time zones and communication preferences. I also conducted one-on-ones to understand and address individual barriers."

      "content": "As a result, engagement increased across all functions. Remote team members began actively contributing, and QA raised critical issues that improved the final product. The team completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule, with higher satisfaction scores from beta users due to the diverse perspectives incorporated."

By building inclusive practices into the team’s daily rhythms, I ensured everyone felt valued and heard. I continue to apply these strategies across teams, improving collaboration, innovation, and retention."
