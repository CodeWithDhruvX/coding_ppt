🎯 Storytelling Method Chosen: SOAR (Situation – Obstacle – Action – Result)
Why SOAR?
The behavioral interview question — “Tell me about a time something felt unfair” — calls for a story that highlights emotional intelligence, professional maturity, and a positive outcome despite challenging circumstances. The SOAR method is ideal here because it not only structures the incident clearly but also emphasizes personal growth and the ability to resolve obstacles with resilience.

🌟 Story: When an Unfair Review Became a Leadership Opportunity
S – Situation
A few years ago, I was working as a Team Lead at a well-known IT services company in Bengaluru. We had just wrapped up a six-month client engagement for a major European bank, where I led the development of a critical module under tight deadlines. The client had sent us a glowing appreciation email for the seamless delivery.

When performance review season came around, I was confident that my contributions would be recognized.

But the reality was different.

O – Obstacle
To my surprise, my appraisal reflected an “average” rating. It felt unfair. I had taken ownership of client escalations, mentored two junior developers, and even voluntarily stepped up during a team member’s absence. I was disappointed—but more than that, I was confused.

Digging deeper, I realized the issue: my reporting manager had changed midway through the project. The new manager hadn’t been part of our day-to-day execution and had only partial visibility into my actual contributions. Due to organizational constraints, there was no peer input or formal 360-degree feedback in the process. The rating was based on incomplete information.

A – Action
Instead of reacting emotionally or complaining, I decided to approach the issue professionally.

I created a short, structured report that highlighted:

The module I led and its impact on the client’s KPIs

The team management responsibilities I had taken up

Appreciation emails and weekly status reports as supporting evidence

Feedback snippets from colleagues, captured informally

I then requested a one-on-one with my manager—not to argue, but to present my side of the story with clarity and context. During the meeting, I focused on outcomes, not emotions. I calmly explained the mismatch and emphasized that my intention was to maintain transparency and alignment.

R – Result
The manager appreciated my initiative and the way I handled the situation. He admitted that the visibility gap had affected his judgment and promised to escalate the matter. Within a week, my evaluation was reviewed and updated to reflect a more accurate performance score.

But more than the rating, what stood out was the shift in perception.

The manager started trusting me more, involved me in planning discussions, and even nominated me for a leadership grooming program the following quarter. The entire experience turned into a credibility-building moment—not just for my career, but for my professional reputation.

🧠 Reflection
This experience taught me something powerful: fairness isn’t always automatic—but it can be earned through clarity, communication, and courage.

In high-pressure environments like Indian IT services, where projects and personnel often rotate rapidly, visibility matters. It’s easy to feel sidelined or overlooked. But rather than becoming bitter, I chose to be better.

When something feels unfair, it’s not about blaming the system—it’s about respectfully owning your narrative and presenting it with facts, not frustration.

That one change in approach helped me evolve—not just as an employee, but as a future leader.
