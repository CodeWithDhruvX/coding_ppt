      "title": "What is Kubernetes?",
      "content": "Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google based on their internal system called Borg and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure and offers a powerful, flexible way to run distributed systems reliably. It supports multiple container runtimes like Docker and containerd and integrates with various cloud providers and on-premise data centers.",

    {
      "title": "Why Kubernetes?",
      "content": "Before Kubernetes, deploying applications across multiple servers was manual, inconsistent, and error-prone. Kubernetes revolutionized the process through declarative configuration, meaning users define what they want, not how to achieve it. It automates load balancing, scaling, self-healing, and rollback. This reduces downtime and operational overhead, enabling DevOps and SRE teams to manage systems with greater resilience and repeatability.",

      "title": "Kubernetes Architecture Overview",
      "content": "Kubernetes follows a master-worker (control plane-node) architecture. The Control Plane makes global decisions (e.g., scheduling), maintains cluster state, and manages lifecycle events. Worker Nodes run actual containerized workloads. Key components include: API Server (frontend to the cluster), Scheduler (assigns workloads), Controller Manager (ensures desired state), etcd (key-value store), kubelet (runs containers), and kube-proxy (network routing).",

      "title": "Kubernetes Control Plane Components",
      "content": "### Control Plane:\n- **API Server**: Acts as the central gateway, validating and processing REST operations and managing the cluster state through etcd.\n- **etcd**: A highly available, consistent key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.\n- **Controller Manager**: Runs various background controllers to monitor the cluster and reconcile its current state with the desired state.\n- **Scheduler**: Assigns newly created Pods to appropriate nodes based on resource requirements and constraints like affinity or taints.",

      "content": "### Node:\n- **kubelet**: An agent that ensures containers described in PodSpecs are running and healthy on the node. It communicates with the control plane and reports back node status.\n- **kube-proxy**: Manages networking rules on nodes, allowing network communication to your Pods from inside or outside the cluster using services.\n- **Container Runtime**: The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O), complying with Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI).",

You submit this file using the `kubectl apply -f` command.\n3. The API Server validates the configuration and stores the desired state in etcd.\n4. The Scheduler watches for unassigned Pods and places them on appropriate Nodes.\n5. Kubelet on those Nodes reads the PodSpec and starts the necessary containers using the Container Runtime.\n6. Controllers continuously monitor the cluster and take action to ensure the actual state matches the desired state (e.g., restarting failed Pods).",
