      "title": "What is Docker?",
      "content": "**Docker** is an open-source platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers.\n\nContainers are standardized units of software that package up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably in any computing environment. This solves the classic problem of “it works on my machine” by ensuring the environment is consistent across development, testing, and production.\n\nDocker also provides tools to build container images, run containers, manage container lifecycles, and share images through registries like Docker Hub.",

      "content": "**Kubernetes** is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\n\nIt automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of machines. Kubernetes provides advanced features such as:\n\n- **Self-healing**: Automatically replaces failed containers\n- **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly\n- **Auto-scaling**: Scales applications based on demand\n- **Rolling updates**: Updates applications with zero downtime\n\nKubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on deploying applications instead of managing servers.",

It's best suited for teams requiring high availability, automated deployments, and robust scaling capabilities.\n\nIn large-scale systems, Docker is often used to create containers, while Kubernetes is used to orchestrate and manage those containers across clusters.",

While Kubernetes can use other container runtimes (like containerd), Docker is still widely used in the container creation and CI/CD phase.\n\nThus, Kubernetes extends Docker by managing container deployment, health, networking, and scaling.",
