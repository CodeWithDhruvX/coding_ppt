      "content": "A **Kubernetes Cluster** is the fundamental architecture where Kubernetes manages and runs containerized applications. It consists of multiple machines (called nodes) that work together. These nodes can be physical servers or virtual machines. Kubernetes orchestrates these nodes to ensure that applications run reliably, can scale on demand, and recover from failures automatically. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building applications without worrying about the hardware.",

      "content": "- **Master Node (Control Plane)**: Acts as the brain of the cluster. It makes decisions about the cluster such as scheduling, detecting and responding to events.\n- **Worker Nodes**: Machines where your application actually runs. These are managed by the control plane.\n- **Kubelet**: An agent on each worker node that makes sure containers are running in a Pod as expected.\n- **Pods**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster and may contain one or more containers.",

Docker was traditionally used, but alternatives like containerd and CRI-O are also supported.\n- **Pods**: Each Pod runs one or more containers and shares storage and network resources, making it a basic deployable unit in Kubernetes.",
