Alright, let’s talk about “Defer with named return value.”

So what does that even mean?

In Go, sometimes when we write a function, we give a name to the return value right in the function signature. This is called a named return value. And when we use defer in such a function, it actually gets a chance to change that return value before it’s finally returned.

Sounds a bit technical? Don’t worry, let me break it down.

Imagine you're submitting a college assignment. You finish writing it, but just before handing it in, your friend says, “Hey, you made a small spelling mistake — fix it before submitting!” You quickly correct it and then submit. That final correction is like what defer does — it runs at the end, just before your work is officially turned in.

In Go, if you’ve named your return value, the defer block can directly update it right before it goes out of the function. This is super useful when you want to log something, clean up, or even tweak the final result in one last step.

It’s a powerful feature — but only works when you’ve named that return value.

We’ll look at some code examples next, but for now just remember:

With named return values, defer is like your final chance to polish the result before it leaves the function.




==============================================================================



Here’s a simple Go function:

go
Copy
Edit
func getNumber() (result int) {
    defer func() {
        result += 1
    }()
    return 5
}
Now let’s go through it step by step.

The function is called getNumber, and it’s returning an int.
But notice this — the return value is named. It’s called result.

This is important. Since we’ve given a name to the return value, Go treats result like a normal variable inside the function.

Then, we have a defer statement.

Inside that deferred function, we write result += 1.

So what’s happening here?
We’re saying:
“After everything else in the function is done — just before it returns — please add 1 to result.”

Now look at the return line.
We’re returning 5.

But remember, before the function ends, the defer block runs. So result becomes 6.

That means this function will finally return 6, not 5.

💡 This is a small but powerful concept.
If you’re doing things like error handling, logging, or adjusting the result — this trick can be super handy.

But again, this only works because we named the return value.

If the return value didn’t have a name, the deferred function wouldn’t be able to modify it.

So the key takeaway?
Defer can tweak the result — but only if it knows the name.




===================================================================================================


Let’s now understand what actually happened in that previous example — step by step.

So first, we had a return value called result, and it was named right in the function signature.
This means that inside the function, result behaves just like a regular variable — it’s already declared and ready to use.

Then comes the key part — we used a defer statement.
Now here’s the interesting bit: even though we wrote return 5, the defer block still runs after that line, but before the function actually finishes.

It’s like telling Go:
“Hey, return 5 — but before you walk out, just run this last-minute line of code.”

And in that last-minute line, we said: result += 1.
So 5 becomes 6.

That’s why the final return value is not 5, but 6.

💡 This small trick is really handy when you want to adjust or clean up something right before returning — especially when working with logs, errors, counters, or closing resources.

Just remember:
For defer to change the return value, that return value must be named.

Otherwise, Go won’t know what variable to update.




=================================================================================



Now let’s look at the opposite case — what happens when we don’t use a named return value.

The slide says:

If no named return value is used, deferred functions cannot change the returned value directly.

So what does that mean in simple terms?

Let’s say you're writing a function and you're just returning a value like this — return 5. But you didn’t give that return value a name like result.

Now even if you use a defer inside that function, it cannot reach or change that return value. Why? Because Go doesn’t have a variable to modify. There's no “label” on that returned value.

It’s kind of like trying to change a train ticket that doesn't have your name on it. If the ticket isn’t assigned to anyone, no one knows who it belongs to — so you can’t update it.

So the key thing to remember here is:

If you don’t name the return value, defer can still run, but it won’t be able to affect the final result.

This matters a lot when you’re doing cleanup, adjusting return values, or writing functions where the result depends on what happens in defer.

So just be careful — if you want defer to have any control over the return value, make sure to name it.
