### Slide: **Introduction to defer**

Alright, so today we’re talking about one of Go’s most elegant little features: `defer`.

Think of `defer` as a kind of "reminder note" you leave for Go: “Hey, once you're done with this function, *don’t forget to run this last thing*.”

It’s super handy when you're doing stuff that needs to be cleaned up afterward—like closing a file, unlocking a mutex, or logging something before your function exits.

Why do we need this? Well, imagine you're baking a cake, and you always want to clean up the kitchen right after. You don’t want to *forget* that step, especially if there’s a lot going on. That’s what `defer` helps with. It ensures cleanup happens—no matter how your function exits, whether it succeeds, fails, or even crashes.

---

### Slide: **Basic defer usage**

Let’s look at the simplest example of `defer` in action.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("World")
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

So what’s going on here?

- First, we print `"Hello"`.
- Then the function ends.
- Right *before* it finishes, it checks: “Do I have any deferred tasks?”
- Ah yes! We told it to `defer fmt.Println("World")`. So that runs last.

And the output is:

```
Hello
World
```

Notice how `"World"` is scheduled, but doesn't execute until the function is just about to return. That’s the magic of `defer`.

### Slide: **How defer works**

Now, behind the scenes, `defer` uses a **stack**.

What’s a stack? Think of it like a stack of plates in your kitchen. You put things on top, and when it's time to clean up, you take the *last one you added* first. That’s called **LIFO**: Last In, First Out.

So every `defer` call you make gets pushed onto this stack. When your function exits, Go starts popping off each deferred function in reverse order.

This is really useful when you want your cleanup to happen in the reverse order of setup. Super neat for resource management.

---

### Slide: **Multiple defers**

Check this out:

```go
func demo() {
    defer fmt.Println("Third")
    defer fmt.Println("Second")
    defer fmt.Println("First")
}
```

Here’s what happens:

- `defer fmt.Println("Third")` is added to the stack.
- Then `Second`.
- Then `First`.

So when the function exits, it prints:

```
First
Second
Third
```

Because of the LIFO order. So remember, the last `defer` you wrote is the first to run.

This is super useful when you're acquiring resources in a particular order and want to release them in the opposite order. Like opening a file, locking a mutex, and starting a timer—cleanup should reverse that setup flow.

### Slide: **Common use cases for defer**

Here are some really common places you’ll see `defer`:

| Use Case              | Example                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Closing files         | `defer file.Close()`                |
| Unlocking a mutex     | `defer mu.Unlock()`                 |
| Logging               | `defer log.Println("Exiting...")`   |
| Recovering from panic | `defer recover()`                   |

So if you open a file, you might write:

```go
file, _ := os.Open("myfile.txt")
defer file.Close()
```

This way, even if your code hits an error halfway through, that file *will still* be closed properly. It’s like having a cleanup crew always ready at the door.

And if you're working with goroutines and shared resources, `defer mu.Unlock()` helps make sure you don’t accidentally leave a lock hanging. That can cause nasty deadlocks.

### Slide: **Defer with return values**

Here’s where things get spicy 🔥.

```go
func test() (result int) {
    defer func() {
        result++
    }()
    return 1
}
```

Okay, let’s break this down.

- We're using a **named return value**: `result int`.
- Inside the function, we return `1`.
- But *before* the function actually exits, our deferred function runs and increments `result`.

So even though we `return 1`, the final value that comes out is **2**.

Why? Because `defer` runs after the `return` statement but before the function *fully exits*. And since we named our return variable, the deferred function can still modify it. Sneaky, right?

This can be super powerful—but also confusing if you're not careful. More on that soon.

### Slide: **Defer in real-world example**

Let’s say you're reading a file:

```go
func readFile(filename string) {
    file, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    // process file...
}
```

Here, `defer file.Close()` ensures that no matter what happens during file processing—even if an error or panic occurs—the file is closed properly.

This pattern is **so common** in Go that you’ll see it almost every time someone opens a file. It’s clean, safe, and easy to read.

### Slide: **Important notes**

Some key things to keep in mind with `defer`:

- Deferred functions **always run**, even during a **panic**. This makes them useful for emergency cleanup.
- The **arguments** to a deferred function are evaluated **immediately**, even if the function runs later.

So, for example:

```go
defer fmt.Println(time.Now())
```

That timestamp gets locked in at the moment you hit `defer`, not when it actually prints. That trips up a lot of beginners.

Also—be cautious in loops. Deferring in a loop can add hidden performance costs.

### Slide: **When not to use defer**

Here’s when you *might* want to avoid using `defer`:

| Scenario                     | Why Avoid                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| High-performance loops      | Adds a bit of overhead per iteration |
| Very simple code blocks     | Might make logic less clear          |
| Large files with many ops   | Explicit cleanup may be clearer      |

In other words—don’t reach for `defer` *just because*. Think about clarity and performance. It’s a tool, not a rule.

### Slide: **Defer and return timing summary**

Here’s a great cheat sheet:

| Case                   | Effect                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Named return variable  | Can be modified by `defer`             |
| Unnamed return variable| Value copied before `defer` runs       |
| Pointer return         | `defer` can update what pointer points to |

So if you want to modify a result inside a `defer`, **use a named return** or **return a pointer**.

Otherwise, `defer` can’t reach the return value—it’s already been finalized.

### Slide: **Best practices with defer**

Let’s wrap this up with some best practices:

- Use **named returns** if your deferred function needs to modify the return value.
- Don’t overuse `defer` for clever tricks. Favor **readability** and **clarity**.
- Be aware of **performance**, especially inside loops or performance-critical code.

---

### Slide: **Summary**

Here’s your `defer` TL;DR:

- It schedules code to run **after the current function finishes**.
- It’s perfect for **cleanup**: closing files, unlocking mutexes, logging exits.
- Deferred functions run in **reverse order** (LIFO).
- Use **named returns** or **pointers** if you want to change return values.
- Avoid using it in tight loops unless you're sure the cost is worth it.

🎉 That’s a wrap!

Now that you understand `defer`, you’ll start seeing it everywhere in Go code. It’s a tiny keyword, but it makes your code **cleaner**, **safer**, and **more reliable**.
