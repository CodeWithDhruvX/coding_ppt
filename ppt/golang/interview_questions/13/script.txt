**🎙️ [Slide 1: Introduction to Function Literals]**

"Alright folks, let's dive into something super useful in Go—*function literals*. You might’ve also heard them called *anonymous functions*. So what are they?

Imagine you're in a kitchen, and instead of naming every tool and labeling it with a tag, you just grab a knife, use it, and move on. That’s kind of what a function literal is. It’s a function… without a name.

In Go, we can define a function on the spot, right where we need it. You don’t have to go and write it elsewhere with a fancy name—just boom! Right there. And we can either use it immediately, or assign it to a variable and reuse it.

Why would you want to do this? Well, it helps keep your code cleaner and more focused. You’re not cluttering your project with dozens of tiny one-off function names that you’ll never use again."

**🎙️ [Slide 2: Syntax of Function Literal]**

"Let’s take a look at what a basic function literal looks like:

```go
func(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

So what’s going on here?

- We’re defining a function that takes in two integers: `a` and `b`.
- It returns an integer—specifically, the result of adding `a + b`.

But notice—there’s no name! That’s what makes it anonymous. It's like a guest at a party who shows up, drops off a gift, and leaves without ever telling you their name.

Now, by itself, this won’t do anything unless we *use* it. So let’s move on to that."

**🎙️ [Slide 3: Assigning to a Variable]**

```go
add := func(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

fmt.Println(add(3, 4)) // Output: 7
```

"Here’s where things get interesting.

We're saying: 'Hey, take this anonymous function and assign it to a variable called `add`.' Now, `add` behaves just like any other function. You can call it with `add(3, 4)` and get back `7`.

So it’s like this: imagine you wrote a little calculator function on a sticky note, and then you stuck it to your fridge. Anytime you need it, you just glance at that sticky note—no need to rewrite it.

And this pattern is super handy for situations where the logic is short, and you want to keep things tidy."

**🎙️ [Slide 4: Immediate Invocation]**

```go
result := func(a int, b int) int {
    return a * b
}(3, 4)

fmt.Println(result) // Output: 12
```

"Now this is what we call *immediate invocation*—basically, you define the function and call it right away.

Let me explain what's happening:

- We define a function that multiplies two numbers.
- And *immediately after*, we put `(3, 4)` to invoke it right on the spot.
- The result gets stored in the variable `result`.

This is like writing a quick equation on a napkin, calculating the answer, and then tossing the napkin. You don’t keep the function around—it serves its purpose right then and there.

This technique is great for quick computations or operations that don't need to live beyond that moment."

**🎙️ [Slide 5: Use Case – Inline Functions]**

"So why even use function literals?

Well, here are a few killer use cases:

- **Encapsulating short logic**: If the logic is only a couple of lines, there's no need to define a separate function.
- **Avoiding name clutter**: You don’t want to pollute your codebase with a bunch of unnecessary function names.
- **Useful in goroutines, callbacks, or closures**: In other words, when you need quick, disposable logic that does something important but doesn’t need a label.

For example, imagine you’re spinning up a goroutine to do a task. You can just toss in an anonymous function and let it do its thing."

**🎙️ [Slide 6: Function Literal with Closure]**

```go
counter := func() func() int {
    count := 0
    return func() int {
        count++
        return count
    }
}()

fmt.Println(counter()) // 1
fmt.Println(counter()) // 2
```

"Now this is where function literals get *really* powerful—we’re talking about *closures*.

Let’s break it down:

- We have a function that returns… another function!
- Inside the outer function, we declare a variable `count`.
- The inner function increases `count` every time it’s called.

And here's the magic: even after the outer function finishes running, the inner function *remembers* the value of `count`.

It’s like having a secret notepad that only one specific person can write on and read from. Every time they open the notepad, they see the history. That’s what closures do—they *remember* the environment they were created in.

This is super useful when you want to keep state but don’t want to use global variables or more complex structures."

**🎙️ [Slide 7: Common Uses of Anonymous Functions]**

| Use Case         | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Callbacks        | Pass function as argument for async logic        |
| Goroutines       | Launch short-lived concurrent code blocks        |
| Closures         | Maintain state across multiple calls             |
| Functional Style | Apply, map, or filter-like patterns              |

"Let’s summarize some common scenarios where anonymous functions really shine:

- **Callbacks**: These are functions you pass into other functions, like event handlers. For example, when something finishes downloading, call *this* function.
- **Goroutines**: When you want to run a task in the background without naming it, just fire off an anonymous function in a goroutine.
- **Closures**: Like we just saw, closures let you preserve some private data across calls.
- **Functional Style**: Go isn’t a purely functional language, but you can still get that map/filter feel using anonymous functions with slices.

These patterns are everywhere in modern Go codebases."

**🎙️ [Slide 8: Summary]**

"So, to wrap this up:

- Function literals, aka anonymous functions, are just functions without a name.
- You can assign them to variables, pass them around, or execute them right away.
- They're perfect for short, focused logic where naming isn’t necessary.
- And when combined with closures or goroutines, they become incredibly powerful tools.

If you’re new to Go, play around with these! Try using them in small examples—maybe a counter like we built earlier or a quick filter function for a slice.

And hey, don’t worry if they feel weird at first. Anonymous functions are one of those things that *click* after a little hands-on practice.

Alright, that’s it for this one! Hope you learned something cool—and as always, if you’ve got questions or want a part 2 on closures or goroutines, let me know in the comments!"
