# Learning Plan: DSA & Software Architecture (Randomized)

## ðŸ“† Overview

This learning plan is designed to help you systematically master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Software Architecture** in a **4-week cycle**, with a balanced focus on both areas. The plan progresses from **beginner** to **advanced** concepts, covering a wide range of topics. The goal is to mix foundational knowledge with hands-on practice while encouraging consistent learning.

### Time Commitment

- **1 hour per day, 5 days a week** (totaling approximately 1 hour/day Ã— 5 days/week Ã— 4 weeks).

---

## ðŸ”„ How the Randomized Plan Works

Every **4 weeks**, the topics will be randomly shuffled, covering a **balanced mix of DSA** and **Software Architecture** concepts. This will ensure that you stay engaged with both foundational and advanced topics while making steady progress.

### How Topics are Randomized:

1. **DSA Topics:**

   - **Beginner**: Arrays, Strings, HashMaps, Two Pointers, Sliding Window.
   - **Intermediate**: Binary Search, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Recursion, Trees.
   - **Advanced**: DP, Graphs, Tries, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms.
2. **Architecture Topics:**

   - **Beginner**: MVC, Layered Architecture, Singleton, Factory.
   - **Intermediate**: DDD, Microservices, Event-driven, Clean Architecture.
   - **Advanced**: CI/CD, Docker & Kubernetes, API Gateway, Load Balancing.

## ðŸ“… Sample Randomized 4-Week Plan

Each week will contain activities for **DSA** (3 days/week) and **Architecture** (2 days/week). Here's an example of how your randomized 4-week plan might look:

## ðŸ“Œ How to Request a New Randomized Plan

To request a **new randomized 4-week learning plan**, simply ask me by providing the following prompt:

> **"Please generate a randomized 4-week learning plan for DSA and Software Architecture, focusing on beginner to advanced topics."**

- You can specify your preferences (e.g., specific topics, tools, or resources you'd like to focus on).
- I will create a randomized plan based on your request, ensuring itâ€™s balanced and progressively challenges you.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Tips for Success

- **Stay Consistent**: Dedicate 1 hour every day to learning.
- **Hands-on Practice**: Apply theoretical knowledge through coding challenges and projects.
- **Reflect & Review**: At the end of each week, review what youâ€™ve learned, reflect on areas for improvement, and refine your approach.

---

### Note: You can request a new plan for any period (e.g., another 4 weeks) based on this structure.
