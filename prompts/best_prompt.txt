Generate structured interview questions for the following 7 technologies:
1. Go (Golang)
2. Kubernetes
3. TypeScript
4. Angular
5. Microservices
6. Docker
7. Azure

For each technology, generate:
- 3 Beginner-level questions
- 3 Intermediate-level questions
- 3 Advanced-level questions

Each question should include the following fields:
- **Technology**
- **Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced)
- **Concept** (technical concept being tested)
- **Real-World Scenario** (practical application use case)
- **Interview Question** (based on the concept and scenario)

Output the results in **table format** with the columns:
**Technology | Level | Concept | Real-World Scenario | Interview Question**

Ensure all questions are **unique**, non-repetitive, and relevant to real-world professional roles like Developers, DevOps, SREs, Architects, and Frontend/Backend Engineers.

Generate interview question data using the following 4-column format:

Concept: A key technical or theoretical topic in [INSERT TECHNOLOGY or DOMAIN].

Real-World Scenario: A practical, industry-relevant example or problem that highlights the use of the concept in action.

Role-Based Category: The job role or specialization the question is relevant to (e.g., Backend Developer, DevOps Engineer, Project Manager, Data Analyst, etc.).

Interview Question: A question that tests the candidateâ€™s understanding of the concept through the lens of the real-world scenario and is relevant to the specified role.

Ensure the output:

Explains the concept clearly through the scenario.

Aligns the question with day-to-day job responsibilities.

Uses domain-specific language familiar to professionals.

Is suitable for interviews (not too theoretical, and focused on problem-solving or decision-making).
