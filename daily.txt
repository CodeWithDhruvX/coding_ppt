# üìö 4-Week Learning Plan for DSA and Software Architecture

## Overview

This is a **4-week structured plan** to help you master both **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Software Architecture** by dedicating **1 hour per day**. The plan balances theory and practice, focusing on solving problems and building systems using core architectural concepts.

Each week is divided into **5 days** of learning, with **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday** focused on **DSA**, and **Tuesday and Thursday** dedicated to **Software Architecture**.

## üìÖ **4-Week Plan Breakdown**

### **Week 1: Reinforce Basics and Introduction to New Topics**
| Day       | Focus Area    | Activity                                                   |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | DSA           | Solve 2 problems based on recently learned topics (Arrays, Strings, HashMaps) |
| Tuesday   | Architecture  | Watch or read tutorials on a new architectural pattern (MVC, Microservices) |
| Wednesday | DSA           | Solve 1 medium problem related to the new topic            |
| Thursday  | Architecture  | Build a small feature or service based on the architecture pattern (e.g., REST API) |
| Friday    | DSA           | Review the week's problems, discuss time/space complexities, and solve a LeetCode challenge |

### **Week 2: Intermediate Problem Solving and Deeper Design Concepts**
| Day       | Focus Area    | Activity                                                   |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | DSA           | Solve 1 problem based on an advanced technique (Sliding Window, Binary Search) |
| Tuesday   | Architecture  | Study Domain-Driven Design (DDD) or other intermediate concepts |
| Wednesday | DSA           | Solve 2 problems (easy + medium) to reinforce understanding |
| Thursday  | Architecture  | Reverse-engineer a GitHub project or refactor an app to use DDD |
| Friday    | DSA           | Review complexity analysis and practice solving under time constraints |

### **Week 3: Advanced Problem Solving and System Design**
| Day       | Focus Area    | Activity                                                   |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | DSA           | Solve 2 advanced problems (e.g., Recursion, Dynamic Programming) |
| Tuesday   | Architecture  | Learn about microservices, CI/CD, or event-driven architecture |
| Wednesday | DSA           | Solve a challenging problem and analyze time/space complexity |
| Thursday  | Architecture  | Build a simple microservice (e.g., authentication service) |
| Friday    | DSA           | Review the hardest problem of the week and discuss alternative approaches |

### **Week 4: Refinement, Review, and Real-World Application**
| Day       | Focus Area    | Activity                                                   |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | DSA           | Solve 1 hard problem (focus on DP, Graphs, or Trees)      |
| Tuesday   | Architecture  | Study the C4 model and document architecture using it      |
| Wednesday | DSA           | Review the week's problems, identify weak areas and rework |
| Thursday  | Architecture  | Build a complete feature using Clean Architecture (e.g., Task Management System) |
| Friday    | DSA           | Participate in a weekly contest or solve multiple hard problems from LeetCode or Codeforces |

## üìà **Key Guidelines for Each 4-Week Cycle**

- **Week 1**: Focus on reinforcing foundational knowledge and learning new architectural patterns. Start solving basic problems to get into a rhythm.
- **Week 2**: Transition to intermediate topics in both DSA and architecture. Start applying concepts in more complex scenarios.
- **Week 3**: Begin solving harder problems and dive into advanced system design concepts like microservices and CI/CD.
- **Week 4**: Focus on refining skills, solving more advanced problems, and applying architectural concepts in real-world projects.

---

## üîÑ **Repeat and Adjust Based on Progress**

- After each 4-week cycle, reflect on your progress and identify weak areas. Spend extra time on topics you found difficult or need further practice with.
- Gradually **increase the complexity** of problems in DSA, and build more advanced systems and architectures in software development.
- **Track your progress** and adjust the difficulty as you grow more comfortable with concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Resources**

| Area         | Tools                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| DSA          | LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, Anki           |
| Architecture | GitHub, Mermaid.js, Excalidraw, Structurizr, PlantUML|

## üìå **Tips for Success**

- **Consistency**: Dedicate 1 hour every day to this plan to maintain steady progress.
- **Hands-on Practice**: Build small projects to apply the concepts learned in architecture. Don‚Äôt just focus on theory‚Äîapply it!
- **Challenge Yourself**: Solve problems under time constraints to simulate real interview conditions.
- **Review**: At the end of each week, review the concepts, discuss your solutions, and identify areas for improvement.

I finished the 4-week plan and want the next set of topics for DSA and architecture.please consider that giving only 1 hour per day only.
